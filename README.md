# About Me

I currently live in Wyoming, but I grew up in a military family so I'm really from all over the country, and even other parts of the world.

I don't really have too much job experience outside of retail, fast food, and an internship at the county government IT department in high school.

Once I hit my 20s a medical condition I have worsened and I now have to work from home, which is why I'm seeking this degree.

As far as hobbies, I enjoy reading, video games, and tabletop roleplaying games with friends. My wife was also a film student, so we enjoy watching shows and films together, as well as camping and visiting state/national parks.
